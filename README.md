# How to check Command Line Argument :
Save and Close the Script:
Ensure your script is saved and closed before running it from the terminal.

Open a Terminal in VS Code:
Open the terminal in VS Code. You can do this by selecting Terminal > New Terminal from the top menu.

Navigate to the Directory (Optional):
If your script is not in the current directory, navigate to the directory containing your script. For example:

cd "D:\"
Run the Python Script with Command-Line Arguments:
Execute your Python script and pass any command-line arguments you want. For example:

python "D:\Programming_Assignment_1.py" arg1 arg2 arg3
Replace arg1 arg2 arg3 with your actual arguments.

Check the Output:
Your script should print the command-line arguments passed to it. For example, if you ran the command above, the output would be:

plaintext
Copy code
Command-line arguments passed:
Argument 0: D:\Programming_Assignment_1.py
Argument 1: arg1
Argument 2: arg2
Argument 3: arg3
This method allows you to check and use command-line arguments in your Python script when running it from the terminal.
